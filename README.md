## Milestone 2a Feedback
I had a difficult time finding your wireframes since they were not linked in your milestone-2.php document.

You have some awesome ideas regarding your layout, and your content strategy is very well defined, but I could use more clarity in the wireframes. I'm concerned that your wireframes are not clear or detailed enough to provide a concrete guide for your front end development phase - especially considering your unique layout ideas. Consider working on the wireframes a little bit more before you being coding your layouts in HTML using Bootstrap. (Lesson forthcoming!) You're almost there, and it's clear you have a well thought out vision for your project. It just needs to be translated to code, which is the challenge! :)

Your venn diagram feature is total custom CSS. This should be fun and challenging. When you get to this point, have a look at these articles:

- [CSS Tricks: Working With Shapes In Web Design](https://css-tricks.com/working-with-shapes-in-web-design/)
- [CSS Tricks: The Shapes of CSS](https://css-tricks.com/examples/ShapesOfCSS/)
- [1st Web Designer: CSS Shapes](http://1stwebdesigner.com/css-shapes/)
- And this! [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)

Really think about how you would like to feature and present your portfolio content specifically. Of course this will depend on what kind of content you plan on featuring. Having a specific plan for the layout of your portfolio items  will inform your HTML structure and if any 3rd party tools might be appropriate. Add this to your wireframes.

There are a few major issues with your HTML. See the Edits &amp; Suggestions section below for a list of the technical issues. Continue practicing, as HTML and CSS complexity is going to skyrocket with the inclusion of Bootstrap. Use the source code from the examples on bootcamp-coders as a guide. (Perfectly ok to view the source as a reference when creating your files!). Consider using the [HTML Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to check your markup for errors.

I'm excited and looking forward to seeing your PWP take shape! Nice work here overall. Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are clear to begin development on your PWP.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
I found the following issues with your HTML:
- Closing &lt;/html&gt; tag is missing
- Your closing &lt;/body&gt; tag is on line 9. The &lt;body&gt; should contain ALL the content that the user will see, and should be closed at the bottom of the document, immediately before the closing &lt;/html&gt; tag.
- No need to include line numbers inside your &lt;ol&gt; (in the interaction flow). Those line numbers are created for you when you use in Ordered List.

## Milestone 3/Final Feedback
You've got a good start here. Good work getting the ASO deployment up, .htaccess redirect working, and your contact form working on bootcamp-coders.(I know ASO is crapping out on you here). Your directory structure is great, and your HTML and CSS is looking clean. Continue to work on this project and practice your front-end skills. Feel free to Slack me if you have any questions. Your Milestone 3/Final PWP passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Your content pages are not responsive on mobile. (work, play, contact). Your home page is fine though. Continue to work on your front-end/HTML and CSS skills.
- Consider trying PHP templating and Root Path down the line.
- Contact page is missing a .container, and closing `</body>` and `</head>` tags.
