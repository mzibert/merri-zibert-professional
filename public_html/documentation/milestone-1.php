		<h1>Purpose, Audience, Goal</h1>
		<h2>Purpose:</h2>
		<p> This project is a professional website where future employers and clients can gain a better sense of who I am both personally and professionally.  A place where they can see my professional portfolio and get a better sense of who I am both as a developer and as an individual.
		</p>
		<h2>Audience:</h2>
		<p>The audience will include professional peers, possible employers and probable clients.
		</p>
		<h2>Goal:</h2>
		<p>To acquire full time work both as a freelance web developer for smaller business clientele, and as a junior developer with a small privately held company who offers me the ability to keep on learning new coding talents while working my way up into a senior developer position.
		</p>
		<h1>Persona:</h1>
		<h2>Name:</h2>
		<p>Doug Sheppler</p>
		<h2>Age:</h2>
		<p>52</p>
		<h2>Occupation:</h2>
		<p>Hiring Manager for GreaterGood.org</p>
		<h2>Technology:</h2>
		<p> Doug is very comfortable with technology, and describes himself as an advanced
			user.  Doug currently uses a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge for both personal and business
			cell phone use.  For traveling, Doug carries the new 12.9-inch iPad Pro with the smart
			keyboard.  When he is at work Doug uses a Lenovo Think Pad with docking station.  Doug
			uses Google Chrome as his default browser, and hates all things Microsoft.
		</p>
			<h2>Background:</h2>
		<p>  Doug has been a hiring manager for 1o years now.  He has worked for some of the
			biggest names in the technology world, like Microsoft and Oracle. He primarily
			hired for technical positions, but has done a few non-technical hiring events.  He
			just recently downshifted from the fast paced tech companies to a large 501C not
			for profit company, and has been tasked with hiring a team of five junior software
			developers. Doug will be sharing the final hiring decisions with the Senior developers
			and the blessing of the Chief Technology Officer.
		</p>
		<h2>Goals:</h2>
		<p>  Doug does not have a lot of free time to go through paper resumes, so he hopes to cut
			down on the amount of time until hire by combing the internet for personal/professional
			websites of junior developers that are both eye catching and full of personality.
		</p>
		<h1>Use Case:</h1>
		<h2>Goal:</h2>
		<p>  Doug wants to find junior developer personal websites that highlight who the
		developer is in a fun, concise way.  Doug wants to see the latest coding technologies
		represented on the site, but wants the UI to be simple while remaining visually appealing
